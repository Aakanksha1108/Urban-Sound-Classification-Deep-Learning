# Urban Sounds Classification 
## Deep Learning Project

### Objective:

The objective of this project is to use deep learning to classify urban sounds from the UrbanSound8k dataset. Whilst there is a large body of research in related audio fields such as speech and music, work on the classification of environmental sounds is comparatively scarce. The dataset has 10 classes of urban sounds (dog bark, car horn, jack hammer, and so on) and the objective is to predict the probability for a given audio clip belonging to each of the classes. 

Real World Applications of this project:

1. Assistive devices for hearing impaired individuals
2. Smart home security systems
3. Predictive maintenance with airborne sound analysis
